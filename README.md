## RNASeqanalysis

## Task

Create visualization, such as heatmap, to identify the genes that have been upregulated or downregulated. 

## Dependency

To run this code the following R/Bioconductor packages are required:
* edgeR
* limma
* DESeq2
* Biobase
* gplots
* ggrepel
* gage
* Select
* ggplot2
* tidyverse
* genefilter
* EnhancedVolcano
* pheatmap
* org.Hs.eg.db
* org.Mm.eg.db

**Generating GeneCounts**

If faced with hardware limitations, run RNA STAR on Galaxy and select GeneCounts as part of the output. 

## Using the code
